# experiments

Experiments is a repository full of subdirectories.
Each subdirectory has its own little experiment and some sort of probably tiny web UI.

## Applications

- **Commitment** â€“ A TypeScript browser app that asks "Today?" with two yes/no toggles for commit and held it. The commit choice locks after 30 seconds until the next day. The build script runs type checking as a linter and executes tests.
